# üíäcs50x-Final-Project: GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice)

Purpose:    
    A secure, digital platform designed for inspectors in the food and pharmaceutical industries to efficiently record, manage, and review inspection reports.

Motivation:
    Addressing the industry's need in developing countries for reliable and efficient inspection systems.

Impact:
    This project can serve as a starting point for developing digital solutions in the field of inspection and compliance.

Features: 
    üìÑ All form fields are dynamically defined, making it easy to create and customize new forms.

    üì∑ Allows capturing photo using the camera or uploading saved image for each inspection.

    üìù Completed inspections can be saved as PDF documents.

Future Improvements:

    üîê Implement admin authentication to enable administrative control over user roles and permissions (User Management).

    üìä Add advanced search and reporting features to the inspections, forms library, and added user management sections.

Installation Tips:

    - Ensure `cs50` and `pdfkit` are installed via pip: 
        pip install cs50 pdfkit

    - SQLite is used for local database storage (no additional setup needed).

    - üìÑ PDF Generation Requirement: Installing wkhtmltopdf
        To enable PDF generation in this application, ensure that wkhtmltopdf is installed and accessible. The application automatically checks both Windows and Linux path for wkhtmltopdf.

        For Windows:
            1- Download the Windows installer from the official wkhtmltopdf downloads page.

            2- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

            3- Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and running: wkhtmltopdf --version
               You should see the installed version number displayed.

        For Linux:
            1- Download the appropriate Linux package from the wkhtmltopdf downloads page.

            2- Install the package using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:  
                sudo apt install ./wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.focal_amd64.deb

            3- Verify the installation by running: wkhtmltopdf --version

        Note: Ensure that the wkhtmltopdf executable is in your system's PATH so that the application can access it.

        By following these steps, you'll have wkhtmltopdf properly installed, allowing the application to generate PDF files successfully.


The database (GMP.db) includes the following tables:

users: stores user information (id, username, hash, role, created_at)

forms: defines inspection form templates (id, name, description, created_by)

form_fields: defines fields within each form (id, form_id, label, field_type, options, required, display_order)

inspections: stores individual inspection reports (id, form_id, inspector_id, submitted_at, location, notes, score)

inspection_fields: stores user responses to each field (id, inspection_id, field_id, value, comment)

inspection_images: stores image filenames related to inspections (id, inspection_id, filename, uploaded_at)
